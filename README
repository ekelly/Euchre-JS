At this point, I'm still throwing code at Euchre with little to no order.  I'll think that I know how to do a specific section, and just code that part.  As such... nothing works.  Currently I'm coding more of the client-side to test joining a game.  Most of the game logic still does not exist however, and while I'm sending a few messages back and forth, most of those don't do anything either.
